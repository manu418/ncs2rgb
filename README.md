# NCS Color visualizer

This simple [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) app converts an [NCS](http://www.ncscolour.com/) color to RGB and visualizes it full screen.
You can also use it to compare two different colors (which is why I made this app in the first place)

Use the up/down arrow keys to change color values.
